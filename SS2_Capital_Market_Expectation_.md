# Capital Market Expectation

## Part 1: Framework and Macro Considerations

### Challenges when formulating CME

#### What is CME?

- Capital market expectations are risk and return expectations regarding  classes of assets.
- Cross-sectional consistency
- Intertemporal consistency

#### Challenges in Forecasting

1. Limitations to using economic data
   - **Time Lag** of the data
   - Data might be **revised** in the future (including methodology)
   - Data index are often **rebased** overtime
2. Data measurement errors and biases
   - Transcription errors
   - Survivorship bias
   - Appraisal data: underestimate the Vol
3. Limitations of historical estimates
    - regime changes -> nonstationary data
    - Nonstationarity: statistical property change over time
    - long time period is preferable for several reasons:
       - statistically required
       - smaller variance to the estimates
       - asynchronous data: can cause distorted correlation
4. Ex Post risk as a biased risk measure of Ex Ante risk
    - Using ex post data (after the fact) to determine ex ante (before the fact) risk and return can be problematic
      - underestimate the risks
      - overestimate their potential returns
    - data series includes even one observation of a rare event, we may substantially overstate the likelihood of such events happening in the future
5. Analyst Methods Bias: non-robust pattern
    - Data-mining
    - Time-period bias
6. Failure to account for conditioning information
7. Misinterpretation of Correlations
8. Psychological biases
9. Model uncertainty
    - **Model uncertainty**: refers to selecting the correct model
    - **Parameter uncertainty**: refers to estimation errors in model parameters
    - **Input uncertainty**: refers to knowing the correct input values for the model

### The trend rate of growth

#### Exogenous Shocks to Growth

- Exogenous shocks:unanticipated events that occur outside the normal course of an economy
  - likely produce statistical regime changes

#### Decomposition of GDP Growth

- The trend growth in GDP is the sum of the following
  - Growth from labor inputs
    - growth in potential labor force size
    - growth in actual labor force participation
  - Growth from labor productivity
    - growth from capital inputs
    - total factor productivity (TFP) growth

#### Anchoring Asset Returns to Trend Growth

- The trend growth rate also provides an anchor for long-run equity appreciation
  - We can express the aggregate market value of equity, V~e~, as the product of three factors: the level of nominal GDP, the share of profits in the economy, S~k~ (earnings/GDP), and the P/E ratio (PE)
  - V~e~ = GDP *S~k~*PE
  - The growth rate of the total value of equity in an economy is linked to the growth rate of GDP

### Approaches to economic forecasting

- econometric modeling
- economic indicators
- checklist approach

### The business cycle

#### Business Cycle Analysis

The business cycle can be subdivided into five phasesï¼š

- Initial recovery
  - Falling inflation
  - Low or falling short-term interest rates
- Early expansion
- Late expansion
- Slowdown
- Contraction

#### Inflation Implications

- Inflation: generally rising prices
- Disinflation: deceleration in the rate of inflation
- Deflation: generally falling prices

| Business Cycle   | Inflation                                              | Economic Policy           | Markets                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial recovery** | Initially declining inflation                          | Stimulative               | - Short-term rates low or declining <br/>Long-term rates bottoming and bond prices peaking<br/>- Stock prices increasing |
| **Early expansion**  | Low inflation and good economic growth                 | Becoming less stimulative | - Short-term rates increasing<br/>- Long-term rates bottoming or increasing with bond prices beginning to decline<br/>- Stock prices increasing |
| **Late expansion**   | Inflation rate increasing                              | Becoming restrictive      | - Short-term and long-term rates increasing with bond prices declining<br/>- Stock prices peaking and volatile |
| **Slowdown**         | Inflation continues to accelerate                      | Becoming less restrictive | - Short-term and long-term rates peaking and then declining with bond prices starting to increase<br/>- Stock prices declining |
| **Contraction**      | Real economic activity declining and inflation peaking | Easing                    | - Short-term and long-term rates declining with bond prices increasing<br/>- Stock prices begin to increase later in the recession |
